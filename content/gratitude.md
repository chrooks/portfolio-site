If there's one thing I've learnt from my time on this planet, it's the value of community. I know that I'm fortunate to be in the position that I am in today due of the many contributions, both large and small, made by theÂ countless people who have helped me along my journey. It truly does take a village, and I'd be remiss not to express my gratitude for the people who have made up mine by attempting to name some of then here:

So,

- Mom
- Dad
- Nicholas
- Auntie Gen
- Uncle Arthur
- Grandma & Grandpa
- Uncle Phil
- Afam
- Lucas
- The Green family
- Taj
- Ethan
- Samir
- Jordan Sealey
- Delano
- Mikaela
- Nia
- J.J.
- Ananda
- Jada
- Coach Johnny
- Coach Trina
- Coach Jenkins
- Coach Caulfield
- Coach Lonergan & Coach Shaw
- Dr. Alexandra To
- Angel
- The John D. O'Bryant African-American Institute staff
- Dr. Castor  
And the many others whose orbits have propelled me in the direction I'm heading now,

From the bottom of my heart, thank you.  
I promise I'll make you proud.
