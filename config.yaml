    content: |-
      I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Northeastern University studying Computer Science with a minor in Africana Studies.

      Being the son of a father who was really into computers in many ways predisposed me to having an affinity towards them. In fact, some of my earliest memories as a child are of playing the original Super Mario for the NES with my Father and older brother. I've always been an inquisitive child, constantly inquiring about how the things in my environment came to be and why they work. I can't help but deconstruct and deepen my comprehension of something that piques my attention or provides me great joy. Given my analytical nature and the amount of time I'd spent with them, it wasn't long before I began to wonder about the inner workings of the technology I was using every day. So, when it came time to select a discipline, Computer Science was an obvious choice.

      Fast-fowarding many years later, my current interests involve learning more about how software is conceptualized, designed, and developed, as well as advancing my career as a software engineer. I'm now looking for internship opportunities in the field of software engineering for the **Summer of 2023 (May - August)** that will help me grow my knowledge before graduating in May of 2024.
