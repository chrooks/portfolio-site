If there's one thing I've learnt from my time on this planet, it's the value of community. I am fortunate to be in the position that I am in today due of the many contributions, both large and small, given by theÂ countless people who have helped me along this journey. It truly does take a village, and I'd be remiss not to express my gratitude for the people who have made up mine by naming a few of them here.

So,

- Mom
- Dad
- Nicholas
- Auntie Gen
- Uncle Arthur
- Grandma & Grandpa
- Uncle Phil
- Afam
- Lucas
- The Green family
- Taj
- Ethan
- Samir
- Jordan Sealey
- Delano
- Mikaela
- Nia
- J.J.
- Ananda
- Jada
- Coach Johnny
- Coach Trina
- Coach Jenkins
- Coach Caulfield
- Coach Lonergan & Coach Shaw
- Dr. Alexandra To
- The John D. O'Bryant African-American Institute staff
- Dr. Castor
- And many more not named here

From the bottom of my heart, thank you.  
I promise that I'll make you all proud.
